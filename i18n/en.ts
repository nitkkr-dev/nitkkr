      over again after 1100 years of subjugation, wars, annexures and

organization once you show interest, would take permission from T&P cell and also consent from
the students interested for that drive. However, we'd highly appreciate if the firm visits our
campus for the recruitments, for we are known for hospitality and we'd love to showcase the
same.`,

student is not allowed to sit for further placement session once he/she is placed. However, all the
students would be eligible to sit for further companies provided 80% of the eligible students of
the particular branch are placed, which we term as “Second round”. For PSUs, the percentage
rolls down to 60% of the eligible students for second round of placement session.`,
